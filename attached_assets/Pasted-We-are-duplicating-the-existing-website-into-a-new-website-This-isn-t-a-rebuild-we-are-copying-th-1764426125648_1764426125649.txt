We are duplicating the existing website into a new website.
This isn't a rebuild — we are copying the current project and preparing it for a new pixel + new domain.

Follow these steps exactly:

1️⃣ Duplicate the entire website project

Make a full clone of the existing site, including:

All pages

All components

All layout files

All styling

All scripts

All assets

The duplicated project should look identical to the original for human users.

2️⃣ REMOVE all Meta Pixel code from the duplicate

Delete all instances of:

<!-- Meta Pixel Code -->
<script>…</script>
<noscript>…</noscript>


And delete any of these if present:

fbq('init', ...)

fbq('track', 'PageView')

fbq('track', 'Lead')

Any leftover pixel inside layout components

Any old tracking scripts

The duplicate must have zero pixels and zero analytics.

3️⃣ KEEP the pixel placeholders

We will insert the new pixel manually after publish.

Inside the duplicated project:

In <head>

Add:

<!-- META PIXEL BASE CODE WILL BE INSERTED HERE -->

Directly after </head>

Add:

<!-- META LEAD EVENT WILL BE INSERTED HERE -->


Do not add any pixel code yet.

4️⃣ Keep the /join page structure EXACTLY the same as the fixed one

Keep:

Confirmation text

Continue button

DOM interaction listener

5-second redirect script

This structure is REQUIRED for Meta to validate Lead.

5️⃣ Adjust minor page details so Meta sees it as a “fresh” site

Do the following small tweaks:

✔ Change logo filename (even if visually identical)
✔ Change image filenames
✔ Change meta title slightly (but keep same style)
✔ Change meta description slightly
✔ Change favicons filename
✔ Change one or two class names
✔ Change order of divs in HTML by 1–2 positions (same visual look)

These micro-changes ensure Meta’s backend treats it as a brand-new property.

The user should NOT notice any difference visually.

6️⃣ Make sure the duplicated project is production-ready

Do a full review:

No pixel code exists anywhere

No errors in console

No leftover JS from the old activation

/join page still works the same

Redirect still works

Clean build generates correctly

All assets load normally

No absolute URLs pointing to old domain

Double-check EVERYTHING before publishing.

Respond only when fully verified.
