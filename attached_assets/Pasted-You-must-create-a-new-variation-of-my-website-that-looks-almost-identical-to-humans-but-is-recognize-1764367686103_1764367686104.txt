You must create a new variation of my website that looks almost identical to humans but is recognized as a different website by Meta’s detection systems.
Follow these rules EXACTLY and confirm them one by one before making changes:

1. KEEP THESE ELEMENTS UNCHANGED

My logo (same file, same name)

My brand name (VictoryPipsFX or the domain name shown on the site)

The main colors (as close as possible)

The overall layout structure (so visitors instantly recognize it)

2. MODIFY THESE ELEMENTS JUST ENOUGH TO BE CONSIDERED A NEW WEBSITE

Meta only needs light structural differences, not visual ones.
Apply all of the following:

🔹 HTML changes

Rewrite every <div> id name and class name (rename them, do not remove them)

Slightly change the HTML ordering where possible

Replace inline HTML comments with new versions

Add 3–4 dummy sections in the HTML that are hidden with CSS (display:none)

Change the DOM structure enough so that fingerprinting sees a different site

🔹 CSS changes

Regenerate ALL class names (example: .header-container → .vc-hd-9823)

Slightly adjust padding/margins (±2–5px)

Keep colors very similar but shift hue or brightness by 1–3%

Add 10–15 lines of unused CSS rules (Meta sees this as a new site)

🔹 JavaScript changes

Change all function names and variable names

Add 1–2 harmless dummy JS functions that do nothing

Randomize variable names (example: btnClick → c9x_btn_21)

🔹 File structure changes

Rename all folder names except for the folder containing the logo

Add 1–2 empty CSS/JS files so Meta fingerprint sees a new structure

3. CONTENT CHANGES

Text content should be lightly rewritten but the meaning remains the same:

Rewrite each sentence with different synonyms

Keep the same overall message and CTA

Keep the same Telegram button but change the button HTML class

Change 2–3 headlines slightly (ex: 'Join our community' → 'Become part of our team')

4. BACKGROUND + IMAGES

Slightly adjust background opacity or brightness

Apply a tiny blur or gradient shift (1–3%)

Do NOT change the logo

Do NOT change the main hero image too much

5. CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

Before replacing anything, save the entire original website as a backup copy in a separate folder called:
/original_backup_website_1/

6. DELIVERABLE

Once all tasks are completed, you must output:

The final updated website files

A list of every structural change you made

Confirmation that the logo, brand name, and visual identity remain the same

Confirmation that the site is now fingerprinted as a distinct site to Meta

Do not over-change the design. Humans should feel it’s basically the same site. Meta should detect it as a new one.
Apply all steps above and tell me once done."
